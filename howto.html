          Make sure it runs in the background. When you download any files via
          IPFS, the process continues running so it can distribute that file
          to peers too. Hence you don't need a central server.
        </p>
        <p> Be sure to check your package manager for IPFS if you have one. </p>

        <p>
          Any podcast client will do, but keep in mind some don't support
          video. gPodder is a simple client focused on audio and video,
          and NewsFlash is an attractive client for articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many available clients, but you only need one, and you
          may already have one installed.

        <h2> 3 | Find some subscriptions </h2>
        <p>
          This may be the hardest part. There's no central server keeping up 
          with all the channels. So you'll need to find them some other way,
          maybe from a friend or another website. Some of these may link to
          localhost:8080, which means the feed also has no server, but instead
          will run through your IPFS installation.
        </p>
        <spacer></spacer>
        To get started, try this example as a new feed in your podcast client:
        <pre>http://localhost:8080/ipns/k2k4r8liyjxanmri70a0rbw7u2dy03078cj4ssijex5cjjizc7628bi5</pre>

    </h1>
    <strong>First set yourself up as a Viewer, then follow these steps</strong>
    <card-deck>
      <article>
        <h2> 1| Install <tt>ipfspod</tt> and create your channel </h2>
        <p>
          If you're on Linux you may already have Python installed.
          Otherwise, you can find it on
          <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python website</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This will create a new directory by the same name,
          and fill it with some templates you can change to your liking.
        </p>

        <h2> 2 | Prepare your video </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Consider encoding your video as
            <a href="https://www.webmproject.org/about/#">webm</a>,
            so anyone can open them, even with Chrome and Firefox, for free.
          </li>
          <li>
            License your work with a
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">open license</a>
            since IPFS depends on people sharing copies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your videos under a few GB so people can still open them on
            old devices
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you need to reencode your video, consider Handbrake for an
          attractive and easy to use GUI consider, or ffmpeg for a powerful
          command line encoder.

        <h2> 3 | Add your post and publish your work </h2>
        <p>
          There are two steps because publishing can take around a minute.
          However, publishing takes about the same amount time regardless
          how many videos are involved. Feel free to add many videos and publish
          once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding a new post is highly configurable, and if you want to
          further customize it, the posts are stored a JSON so they are easy to
          edit automatically or manually.

        <h2> 1 | Make a new channel key </h2>
        <p>
          IPFS files are immutable, but it does include a name system named
          IPNS that allows you to create updatable links. This is the link
          you'll give your subscribers so that their clients can check for
          updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, you create a new cryptographic key. The name is just for
          you, so you can keep track of a lot of links if necessary. IPFS will
          handle storing the key for you. You may also want to export it and
          keep a backup. If you lose it, you will have to give your subscribers
          a new link.

        <p>
          It's called Really Simple Syndication for a reason. Start with this
          example and edit it to match your new channel. Then save it as

        <h2> 4 | Add your video </h2>
        <p>
          You'll need to index your new video with <tt>ipfs add</tt> so
          you get a hash you can include in your enclosure link.
          At this point your file is technically available on the Internet
          but no one can really find it.

        <h2> 5 | Add video details </h2>
        <p>
          Once you're created the information for your channel, add the videos
          you want to share by replacing <tt>VIDEO DETAILS</tt> with stanzas
          like the following, one stanza for each video you want to add.

          Once you have your file ready, upload your new episode list with
          <tt>ipfs add</tt> and then update your IPNS link with
